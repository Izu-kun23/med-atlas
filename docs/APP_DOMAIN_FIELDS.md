# App Domain Fields - What to Fill

## For Testing Mode (Your Current Setup)

**These fields are OPTIONAL** - you can leave them empty for testing!

However, if you want to fill them (to make it look more complete), here are options:

## Option 1: Leave Empty (Recommended for Testing)

✅ **You can leave all three fields empty**  
✅ **This is perfectly fine for testing mode**  
✅ **Google won't block you if these are empty during testing**

## Option 2: Add Placeholder/Simple Links

If you want to fill them, you can use:

### Application home page:
```
https://expo.dev/@izu/med-atlas
```
(Your Expo app profile page)

OR

```
https://medatlas.app
```
(If you have a website)

### Application privacy policy link:
You can create a simple privacy policy page, or use a placeholder:

**Option A:** Create a simple GitHub Pages site with privacy policy
**Option B:** Use a service like:
- https://www.privacypolicygenerator.info/
- Generate a privacy policy and host it somewhere

**Option C:** For testing, you can use:
```
https://expo.dev/@izu/med-atlas
```
(Just point to your Expo page temporarily)

### Application terms of service link:
Similar to privacy policy - create simple terms or use placeholder.

## Option 3: Use Expo/Placeholder URLs (Quick Solution)

For quick testing setup, you can use:

- **Application home page:** `https://expo.dev/@izu/med-atlas`
- **Privacy policy link:** `https://expo.dev/@izu/med-atlas` (same for now)
- **Terms of service link:** `https://expo.dev/@izu/med-atlas` (same for now)

**Note:** These don't need to be actual pages - Google just needs URLs. For testing, pointing to your Expo profile is fine.

## What I Recommend

**For Testing (Right Now):**
- ✅ **Leave them empty** - it's the simplest and works perfectly
- Focus on getting Scopes and Test Users set up first
- You can add these later if needed

**For Production (Later):**
- You'll need actual pages with real privacy policy and terms
- But that's only when you're ready to publish

## Current Priority

1. ✅ App name - Done
2. ✅ User support email - Done  
3. ⚠️ **Scopes** - Check these are added
4. ⚠️ **Test users** - Add your email
5. ⬜ App domain fields - Optional, can skip for now

## Bottom Line

**You can safely leave all three fields empty for testing mode!**

Just make sure:
- Scopes are added (Calendar permissions)
- Test users include your email
- Click "SAVE"

Then try connecting to Google Calendar again!
